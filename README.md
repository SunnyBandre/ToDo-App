# ToDo-App

## Project Description: 
Build a robust and interactive Todo application that leverages the power of **Spring Boot**, **Angular**, and **MySQL** to offer users an intuitive and feature-rich platform for task management. The project's primary goal is to combine the strengths of these technologies to create a simple and engaging task management experience. The "Todo Application" will include the following key features:
    
-  **Task Management:** Allow users to create, edit, delete, and categorize tasks. Each task should include a title, description, due date, and priority level.
    
-  **Task Lists:** Users can organize tasks into lists or categories for better organization and grouping of related tasks.
    
-  **User-Friendly Interface:** Develop a modern, responsive, and user-friendly interface using Angular for a smooth user experience.
    
-  **Search and Filter:** Enable users to search for specific tasks and filter them based on criteria such as priority, due date, or category.
    
-  **Data Persistence:** Utilize MySQL to store user and task data securely.
    
-  **RESTful API:** Develop a RESTful API to facilitate communication between the Angular frontend and the Spring Boot backend.
    
-  **Testing:** Create unit and integration tests to maintain the application's reliability and accuracy.
    
-  **Deployment:** Deploy the application to a cloud platform (e.g., AWS, Heroku) for accessibility to users.
    

By combining Spring Boot, Angular, and MySQL, this Todo application project aims to deliver a powerful and user-centric task management solution. Users will benefit from a feature-rich and visually appealing platform that streamlines their task management, while developers will gain valuable experience in full-stack development with these popular technologies.
